Real-Time Camera Filter

This Python script uses OpenCV to capture video from a camera and apply various filters in real-time. 

The filters include:

Preview : Shows the original video feed

Canny : Applies edge detection to identify boundaries and edges in the image

Blur : Blurs the image to reduce noise and sharpness

Features : Detects corners and draws circles around them
